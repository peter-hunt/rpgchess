This is a python RPG based on chess.

I started this project because I'm personally interested in rpg games and chess mechanics, and I wanted a game for players to have their power heavily based on their own skills, so I'm trying to combine rpg and chess in this project.

The game combat system is like chess, but there's a lot of new abilities, special chess pieces, special board, and etc. I might port this project to C/C++/C# for better performance in the future, but this is just an experimental project.
